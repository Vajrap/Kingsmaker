The game may end in one of three ways:

**🏰 1. Dominance Victory (Instant Win)**

A player wins **immediately** if they meet one of the following:

- **Controls 7 Fortresses or Castles** at the same time
- **Completes all 3 Personal Objectives**
    - Each player draws **3 secret objectives** at game start
    - Objectives can involve control, influence, relics, or diplomacy
    

**📖 2. Story Climax: The Final March (Survival Ending)**

If the **Event Parameter** reaches its maximum value before a winner is declared:

- A **massive enemy force** appears on the board
- Certain **fortresses are destroyed**, routes are blocked
- A powerful **AI-controlled army marches toward all players**
- Game shifts into a **survival mode**—players may form uneasy alliances

🛡 **Ending Condition**: When the enemy stops advancing (after X rounds or triggered events), the game ends

🏆 **Victory**: **All players who survive** are considered winners

**🧮 3. Tiebreaker: Victory Points**

If no one wins by Domination or dies in the Final March, and the game reaches the final round (Event deck ends), count **Victory Points**:

- +2 VP per **Fortress/Castle**
- +1 VP per **City**
- +1–3 VP from **Event/Relic/Objective cards**
- +1 VP for **most influence** in a region

👑 **Highest total wins**
