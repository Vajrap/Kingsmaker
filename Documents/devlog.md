# AI CONTEXT: KingsMaker Development Status

> **AI Data Assistance**: This document tracks development progress for code assistance context. Not intended for human documentation.

## Implementation Status
```
‚úÖ COMPLETED:
- Database service (PostgreSQL + Prisma)
- Shared library (@kingsmaker/shared) + types
- Auth service (Bun + JWT + Redis sessions) 
- Frontend login page (basic implementation)
- Redis service (Docker + state management)
- Lobby service (Bun + WebSocket + Redis)
- Client lobby page (connected to Redis-backed lobby service)
- Client lobby type system (shared types from server)

üîÑ IN PROGRESS:
- Waiting room service architecture
- Game service planning

‚è≥ PENDING:
- Waiting room service (Go)
- Game service (Go)  
- Game client interface
```

## Service Architecture Status
```
auth-service (Bun:7001): ‚úÖ OPERATIONAL
  - HTTP endpoints: login, register, guest, refresh
  - JWT + session management via Redis
  - Database: User model + Session model

lobby-service (Bun:7004): ‚úÖ OPERATIONAL  
  - WebSocket server for real-time communication
  - Room creation/joining/listing
  - Redis state management + pub/sub
  - Session validation integration

redis (Redis:7379): ‚úÖ OPERATIONAL
  - Session storage with TTL
  - Room state management
  - Pub/sub communication hub

postgresql (DB:7432): ‚úÖ OPERATIONAL
  - User data persistence
  - Per-service Prisma schemas

waiting-room (Go:7005): ‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED
  - Planned: Pre-game room management
  - Planned: Player readiness system

game-service (Go:7003): ‚ùå NOT IMPLEMENTED  
  - Planned: Game logic execution
  - Planned: Turn-based gameplay
```

## Current Integration Points
```
‚úÖ auth-service ‚Üî redis (session storage)
‚úÖ lobby-service ‚Üî redis (state + pub/sub)  
‚úÖ lobby-service ‚Üê auth-service (session validation)
‚úÖ client ‚Üî lobby-service (WebSocket + Redis-backed rooms)
‚ùå waiting-room ‚Üî redis (not implemented)
‚ùå game-service ‚Üî redis (not implemented)
```

## Next Implementation Priority
```
1. Waiting room service (Go) - subscribes to lobby room_created events
2. Frontend lobby interface - connects to lobby WebSocket  
3. Game service (Go) - subscribes to waiting room game_start events
4. Complete client flow integration
```
