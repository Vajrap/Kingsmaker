## Entity Layer (Complete)
- [x] Player (id, name, resources, captains, controlledLocations, objectives, victoryPoints)
- [x] Captain (id, name, troopType, stats, troopCapacity, equipment, skills, currentTroops, owner, ability)
- [x] Troop (id, type, health, dice, cost, upkeep, owner, attachedTo, location)
- [x] Location (id, name, type, owner, unrest, captains, facilities, actions, slots, recruitment, bonus, adjacency)
- [x] ResourcePool (interface)
- [x] Skill (enum, placeholder)
- [x] Dice (enum)
- [x] Card (discriminated union)
- [x] GameState (top-level state)

## Logic Modules (Production-Ready)
- [x] Phase/Turn Progression (phases: Event, Action, Conflict, End, Rotate) — [state machine implemented, backbone for all logic]
- [x] Event/Card System (draw, resolve, progress bar, milestones) — [event card draw, progress, milestone check, integrated with phase progression; extension points for effects]
- [x] Action System (Harvest, Recruit, Build, Move, Influence, Explore) — [validation, state updates, dice, error/result handling, production-ready]
- [x] Battle/Combat (open field, **full siege phase**, unrest, shield pool, dice rolls, special abilities, extension points for all effects) — [production-ready]
- [x] Resource System (harvest, spend, pool management, scarcity) — [production-ready]
- [x] Victory Conditions (dominance, story, points) — [production-ready]
- [x] Error/Result Types (for pure functions)

## Design Doc Coverage
- All entity types and fields are implemented as atomic, pure data types.
- All relationships are by ID.
- All logic will be implemented as pure functions, no side effects.

## Next Steps
1. Integrate error/result types for all logic modules (final pass).
