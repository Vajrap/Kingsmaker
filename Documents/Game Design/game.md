## **🔁 Core Gameplay Loop**

The game is played in **Rounds**, with each round consisting of structured phases. At the start of the game, each player rolls a D20—**the highest roller becomes Player A**, the first player.

Each round includes the following phases:

### **1. Event Phase**

- The **starting player** draws the top card from the **Event Deck**.
- Each Event Card contains:
    - **Progress:** Adds points to the global **Event Progression Bar**. When thresholds are reached, corresponding story or world effects trigger immediately.
    - **Effect:** A global modifier that lasts for the round.
        
        *(e.g., “All Harvests yield +1”, “No troop recruitment this round”)*
        

### **2. Action Phase (Player A → B → C → D)**

- Each player takes their full turn, one by one.
- Players receive **1 Action per Captain**, plus one for their **Player Character**.
- Each Captain can perform **1 action per round**.
    
    ### **Available Actions:**
    
    - **Harvest** – Gather resources; each region yields only one specific type.
    - **Recruit Troops** – Spend resources to gain military units.
    - **Recruit Captain** – Attempt to recruit a Captain present in the same location.
    - **Influence** – Spend Influence to affect the current region (e.g., reduce unrest).
    - **Build** – Construct permanent improvements on controlled regions.
    - **Move** – Declare a movement target (actual movement resolves later).
    
    📝 **Note:** All actions resolve immediately, **except “Move”**.
    
    - When selected, a **Move Token** is placed. The movement executes during the next phase.

### **3. Conflict Phase (Reverse Order: D → A)**

- Players now resolve their **Move actions**, in reverse player order.
- If a Captain enters a region with another player’s Captain:
    - The **moving player chooses** whether to initiate a battle.
    - If not, both may coexist—unless restricted by game effects or structure.

### **4. End Phase**

- Remove all temporary effects from the **Event Card**.
- Refresh Captains (remove action markers, reset cooldowns, etc.).
- Check for any triggered round-end effects or conditions.

### **5. Rotate Starting Player**

- The starting player token passes **clockwise** to the next player (A → B → C → D), rotating initiative each round.
