## **⚔️ Open Field Combat Phases**

---

### **1. Cleric Defense Pool (Both Sides)**

- Each side rolls **d3 per Cleric** at the start of the battle.
- This creates your **Cleric Shield Pool**—a bank of dice to reduce incoming **ranged or charge damage**.
- When spent, each die is used **as-is**—if you use a roll of 3 to block 1 damage, you still lose the full 3.
- The pool is **not replenished** during battle—**spend wisely**.

---

### **2. Ranged Phase A: Attacker Fires**

- **Mages** (d3 each) – choose **1 enemy troop type** to target
- **Archers** (d2 each) – damage can be allocated freely among enemy troops
- Defender may reduce total damage using Cleric Shield dice

---

### **3. Ranged Phase B: Defender Fires**

- Same process as above, reversed
- Mages and Archers fire
- Attacker may reduce total damage using their Cleric Shield dice

---

### **4. Cavalry Charge (Attacker Only)**

- Each **Cavalry rolls d6**
- Defender may use Cleric Shield dice to reduce the result
- Attacker allocates resulting damage freely to enemy units by HP

---

### **5. Melee Phase (Simultaneous)**

All surviving units roll:

| **Unit** | **Die Rolled** |
| --- | --- |
| Infantry | d6 |
| Cavalry | d6 |
| Archer | d3 |
| Mage | d2 |
| Cleric | d2 |
| Siege Unit | – |
- Add **+1 d6 per point of Captain’s Might**
- **Cleric shield dice do not apply here**
- Both sides total their damage and remove enemy troops as appropriate (by troop HP)

---

## **🏰 Siege Combat Structure**

> Siege battles use a different structure with a focus on
> 
> 
> **ranged warfare, wall attrition**
> 
> **risky breaches**
> 

---

### **1. Cleric Defense Pool (Both Sides)**

- Each side rolls **d3 per Cleric** at the start of the siege round
- This forms a **Shield Pool** used to reduce **incoming ranged damage**
- Used dice are **not reused**—no partial saves

---

### **2. Attacker Ranged Phase**

- Start with Siege engine
    - Siege engine can only deal damage to wall, 2d6 per engine
- Choose one:
    - **Target Wall HP** → apply full damage
    - **Target Defenders (Mage/Archer)** →
        - Subtract **2 dice** (or more if wall upgraded; remove highest die types first)
        - Then roll Mages (d3) and Archers (d2)
        - Defender may use Shield dice to reduce resulting damage

---

### **3. Defender Ranged Phase**

- Defender rolls:
    - **Mages (d3)**
    - **Archers (d2)**
    - **+2d3 bonus dice** from wall towers/height
- Can target **any attacker unit type**
- Attacker may reduce damage with their Cleric Shield dice

---

### **4. Wall Climb Attempt (Optional)**

- Each **Infantry/Cavalry** may attempt to climb
    - Roll **d20 vs Wall DC** (default: 12)
    - **Success**: joins breach pool
    - **Failure**: unit takes **2d3 damage**
        - If damage ≥ unit HP → **unit is lost**

---

### **5. Breach Check**

- If **Wall HP = 0**, or **enough units breached** (threshold depends on wall type):
    
    → Melee Phase begins **next round**
