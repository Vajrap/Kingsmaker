# AI WORKFLOW: KingsMaker Development Process

> **AI Assistant Guidelines**: This document defines the workflow process for implementing changes in the KingsMaker project.

## üîÑ Standard Implementation Workflow

### Phase 1: Context Gathering
```
1. READ architecture docs in Documents/
   - network-architecture.md
   - auth-session-architecture.md  
   - lobby-system-architecture.md
   - ARCHITECTURE_SEPARATION.md
   - SERVICE_ARCHITECTURE_PATTERNS.md
   - devlog.md (current status)

2. UNDERSTAND current implementation
   - Read existing service code
   - Check docker-compose.yml dependencies
   - Review shared types

3. IDENTIFY integration points
   - What services need to communicate?
   - What Redis keys/patterns to use?
   - What types need to be shared?
```

### Phase 2: Planning & Documentation
```
4. CREATE temp_devlog.md in Documents/
   - Document planned changes
   - List files to be modified
   - Note potential issues/considerations
   - Outline testing approach

5. VALIDATE approach
   - Check against architecture patterns
   - Ensure Redis integration follows established patterns
   - Verify service separation principles
```

### Phase 3: Implementation
```
6. IMPLEMENT changes in order:
   a) Update dependencies (package.json)
   b) Add/modify lib files (redis.ts, state.ts, etc.)
   c) Update main service files (index.ts)
   d) Update docker-compose.yml if needed
   e) Update shared types if needed

7. FOLLOW established patterns:
   - Use SERVICE_ARCHITECTURE_PATTERNS.md
   - Match existing Redis client setup
   - Follow same error handling patterns
   - Use consistent naming conventions
   - CRITICAL: Use correct import patterns (see Import Patterns section)
```

### Phase 4: Validation & Documentation
```
8. READ temp_devlog.md
   - Verify all planned changes completed
   - Check for any missed integration points
   - Ensure testing approach is clear

9. UPDATE final documentation:
   - Clear temp_devlog.md content
   - Update devlog.md with completion status
   - Update architecture docs if patterns changed
   - Note any new integration points

10. SUMMARY for user:
    - What was implemented
    - What files were changed  
    - How to test the changes
    - Next steps if any
```

## üö® Critical Checkpoints

### Before Starting
- [ ] Read ALL architecture docs
- [ ] Understand current service state from devlog.md
- [ ] Create temp_devlog.md with plan

### During Implementation  
- [ ] Follow SERVICE_ARCHITECTURE_PATTERNS.md
- [ ] Match existing Redis patterns from lobby service
- [ ] Update temp_devlog.md with progress
- [ ] Test each change incrementally

### Before Completion
- [ ] All files from temp_devlog.md updated
- [ ] Clear temp_devlog.md content  
- [ ] Update devlog.md with new status
- [ ] Provide clear testing instructions

## üìã Current Task Template

```markdown
# TEMP_DEVLOG.md Template

## Task: [Brief description]

### Planned Changes:
- [ ] File 1: Description
- [ ] File 2: Description  
- [ ] etc.

### Integration Points:
- Service A ‚Üî Service B via Redis key pattern
- New types needed in shared/

### Testing Approach:
- How to verify changes work
- What to test manually

### Considerations:
- Potential issues
- Dependencies
- Order of operations
```

## üö® CRITICAL: Import Patterns

### The Problem: Inconsistent Import Patterns
The project has **TWO DIFFERENT** import patterns that cause issues:

#### ‚ùå WRONG: Relative Path Imports (auth service)
```typescript
// auth service uses relative paths - CAUSES PROBLEMS
import type { User } from "../shared/prisma/generated";
import { prisma } from "../shared/prisma/prisma";
import { type LoginResponse, errorRes, ok } from "../shared/types/types";
```

#### ‚úÖ CORRECT: Package Import (sessionManager service)
```typescript
// sessionManager service uses package imports - WORKS CORRECTLY
import type { User } from "@kingsmaker/shared/prisma/generated";
import { prisma } from "@kingsmaker/shared/prisma/prisma";
import { type ApiResponse, errorRes, ok } from "@kingsmaker/shared/types/types";
```

### How It Works (from Makefile)
1. **`make copy-shared`** copies `../shared/*` to each `services/[service]/shared/` folder
2. **Docker build** uses these copied files for relative imports
3. **Package.json** also declares `"@kingsmaker/shared": "file:../../shared"`
4. **Some services work with `@kingsmaker/shared`**, others need copied files

### The Fix: Use @kingsmaker/shared Everywhere
```typescript
// Always use this pattern:
import { prisma } from "@kingsmaker/shared/prisma/prisma";
import type { User } from "@kingsmaker/shared/prisma/generated";
import { type ApiResponse, errorRes, ok } from "@kingsmaker/shared/types/types";
import { jsonPost } from "@kingsmaker/shared/utils/jsonPost";
```

### Build Process Dependencies
```bash
# Required for proper imports:
1. cd ../shared && bun run build          # Build shared library first
2. make copy-shared                       # Copy to services (for Docker)
3. cd services/[service] && bun install   # Install @kingsmaker/shared package
```

## üéØ Success Criteria

A task is complete when:
1. ‚úÖ All architecture docs have been consulted
2. ‚úÖ temp_devlog.md plan executed fully
3. ‚úÖ Changes follow established patterns
4. ‚úÖ **ALL imports use @kingsmaker/shared pattern**
5. ‚úÖ devlog.md reflects new status
6. ‚úÖ Clear testing path provided to user
